## BatchDrawable interface

Interface for drawables that support hardware instancing.

Instanced drawables supply instance-specific uniforms, offsets, and strides to allow a single draw call to render many instances efficiently.

**Signature:**

```typescript
interface BatchDrawable extends Drawable 
```
**Extends:** [Drawable](doc/markdown/./scene.drawable.md)

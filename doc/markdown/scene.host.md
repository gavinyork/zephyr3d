## Host type

A host object that supports disposal.

Hosts are objects to which scripts can be attached. They are expected to emit a `'dispose'` event compatible with `IDisposable` so that scripts can be automatically detached when the host is destroyed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
type Host = IDisposable;
```
**References:** [IDisposable](doc/markdown/./base.idisposable.md)

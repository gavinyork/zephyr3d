## RuntimeScript class

Base class for runtime scripts that can be attached to a host object.

Lifecycle overview: - onCreated(): Called once per script instance right after construction, before any host is attached. - onAttached(host): Called each time this instance is attached to a host. - onUpdate(deltaTime, elapsedTime): Called every frame/tick while attached. - onDetached(host): Called when detached from a host. - onDestroy(): Called when the instance is no longer attached to any host and is about to be discarded.

Notes: - Hooks may return a Promise to perform asynchronous work (e.g., asset loading). - The generic host type `T` can be `IDisposable` or `null`<!-- -->. If `null`<!-- -->, the script may operate without a concrete host.

**Signature:**

```typescript
declare class RuntimeScript<T extends IDisposable | null> 
```

[onAttached(\_host)](doc/markdown/./scene.runtimescript.onattached.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Called when the script is attached to a host.

This may be called multiple times if the same instance attaches to different hosts over its lifetime.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[onCreated()](doc/markdown/./scene.runtimescript.oncreated.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Called once after construction, before the first attachment to a host.

Use this to initialize internal state, allocate resources, or kick off asynchronous loading needed by the script.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[onDestroy()](doc/markdown/./scene.runtimescript.ondestroy.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Called when the script has no remaining hosts and is about to be discarded.

Use this to release global resources and finalize the script's lifecycle. This is the terminal lifecycle hook for an instance.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[onDetached(\_host)](doc/markdown/./scene.runtimescript.ondetached.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Called when the script is detached from a host.

Use this to stop host-specific behaviors and release host-bound resources.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[onUpdate(\_deltaTime, \_elapsedTime)](doc/markdown/./scene.runtimescript.onupdate.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Called every update/tick while the script is active.

Typical usage includes per-frame logic, animation, and input handling.

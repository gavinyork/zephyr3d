## Matrix4x4.getTanHalfFov() method

Get tangent value of half of the vertical field of view.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getTanHalfFov(): number;
```
**Returns:**

number

0 if this is an orthogonal projection matrix, otherwise the tangent value of half of the vertical field of view

## Remarks

This method assumes that this is a projection matrix (perspective or orthogonal). If the matrix is orthogonal, 0 is returned.

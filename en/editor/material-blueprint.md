# Material System

## Material Blueprint Basics

Material blueprints use a node‑based editing workflow.  
Each node represents a mathematical operation, a constant value, or a texture sample, and its outputs are connected to material channels (such as `BaseColor`, `Roughness`, etc.).

Main node types include:

- **Constant** – Numeric values  
- **Texture** – Texture sampling  
- **Math** – Operations such as `Add` / `Multiply`  
- **Output** – Final material outputs

# Zephyr3d Editor Guide

## Overview

**Zephyr3d Editor** is a visual development environment built on top of the **Zephyr3d rendering engine**, designed to provide a complete and efficient 3D project editing workflow on the Web.  
It integrates **scene editing, asset management, scripting, live preview, and build & deployment**, enabling developers to go from zero to production within a single tool.

Zephyr3d Editor can be used both as a **companion tool for the Zephyr3d engine** and as a standalone editor for prototyping 3D visualization apps, games, and interactive experiences.

## Key Features

- **Pure Web Application**  
  Runs entirely in the browser with no installation required. Cross‑platform by design, supporting both WebGL and WebGPU rendering backends.

- **Local Storage**  
  All project data, assets, and editor configurations are stored in **IndexedDB**, allowing offline editing and management without any cloud dependency.

- **Visual Workflow**  
  Provides **scene hierarchy editing, component property panels, asset import and management**, and supports an entity–component based development model.

- **Scripting & Extensibility**  
  Lets you write custom TypeScript / JavaScript scripts to implement gameplay logic, interactions, and even extend editor functionality.

- **Live Preview & Build**  
  Includes a built‑in real‑time rendering pipeline and debug console for rapid iteration, plus one‑click build for WebGL / WebGPU projects.

- **Modern Browser Compatibility**  
  Works with any modern browser that supports **ES6 modules, IndexedDB, and WebGL / WebGPU**.

- **Open Source**  
  Fully open source under the **MIT license**. You are free to modify, extend, or integrate it into your own toolchain and products.
